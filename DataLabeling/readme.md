Your task is to:

Label whether the company header data (name, address, city) matches with the website (Column F “match”).
If the company redirects to another URL, specify the redirected URL in (Column G “redirected_url”).
The file contains 600,000 rows. Each of you is expected to go through 500 rows, but there should be no overlap between the labelers. 
You can assign different ranges using the index column. Please choose a color and let me know which one you will be using to mark your section.
